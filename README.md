### Introduction

Using the Beer and Breweries data files provided by Budweiser, our group was able to uncover 
information that could be beneficial for Budweiser if they are considering entering the craft 
beer market in the United States. 

The information we focused on was breweries by State, beer styles, container sizes, Alcohol by 
Volume (ABV), and International Bitterness Units (IBU).

The data provided for this analysis consists of 2410 US craft beers from 558 US breweries. The 
data analysis that follows highlights the following in order to describe the current craft beer 
market:

The purpose this project is to provide descriptive information about the current craft beer market 
in the United States.


### The Data
Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US
breweries. The datasets descriptions are as follows.
Beers.csv:
Name: Name of the beer.
Beer ID: Unique identifier of the beer.
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
Brewery ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
Style: Style of the beer.
Ounces: Ounces of beer.

Breweries.csv:
Brew ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.
Name: Name of the brewery.
City: City where the brewery is located.
State: State where the brewery is located.

# Analysis Questions TODO<insert code and answers to questions>

1.   How many breweries are present in each state?

2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six 
observations to check the merged file.

3.   Address the missing values in each column.

4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot 
a bar chart to compare.

5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? 
Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between 
IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  
KNN classification is used to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence 
one way or the other. Budweiser audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to 
understand conceptually.

In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) 
you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or 
techniques used.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  

9. Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser 
may be able to find value in. You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction 
with appropriate statistical evidence. 

## Conclusions TODO<write the final conclusion>

In summary, the primary objective of our project is to take two different dataset, beer data set containing a list of 2410 US crafts beers and breweries dataset containing 558 breweries. We transformed the data in CVS format into data frame using R-programming, inspected and analyzed the structure of the data, merged the data frames, and performed analysis on the merged final data set.

As Data Scientist, it is very rare that we get to work only on a single perfect data. A large percentage of work is to accept different datasets and merge them into one final data frame before processing as it is illustrated in our project. After analyzing the data, statistical inference is then made to the data.

The objective of our project is to provide some valuable information such as summary of two dataset, relation between Alcohol By Volume (ABV) and International Bitterness Unit (IBU), number of breweries in each state and how can be an important to Budweiser, and to compute the median of ABV and IBU. 

Based on our team’s analysis, we found that majority of breweries appears to be clustered towards the west of the Mississippi river with California and Colorado being the top two states. Why do these states mostly CO has the highest number of Breweries? Water is the secrete ingredients making CO the top state for breweries in the world and also winning 2017 gold medal winner. The water alone contains about 80-90% of water chemistry needed to make best beers. CO water has the perfect mix of magnesium, sodium, sulfates, bicarbonates and calcium which determines the hardness of and ultimately its suitability for brewing great testing beers. Hence, we believe that Budweiser should consider thinking about CO in their next project. 

Other state of interest, New Hampshire which we believe has the high potential for growth has the highest beer consumers, due to no beer sale tax but not much breweries. Utah on the other hand has the lowest beer consumer and only allows ABV <4 % which could be due to it being a Mormon state. We were surprised at Nevada being the home of Las Vegas has only two breweries. North and South Dakota are lowest in the number of breweries but are one of the highest in beer consumption capita. 

Our computation of the median IBU and ABV for each state shows that median IBU appears to vary considerably between the states. However, West Virginia falls in the middle with median IBU (37) and Arkansas in the bottom with IBU (7.8).  On the other hand, median ABV per state appears somewhat consistent with Nevada being in the middle with median ABV of 0.0669 which kind of make sense because people who visit Las Vegas majority of the time likes to get drunk, gamble and enjoy their time. Utah again, being the lowest beer consumer also has the lowest ABV of 0.051. 

IBU which stands for International Bitterness Units, a measure of the bitterness in beer. There is a saying spicier the better, same applies to the beers as well. Bitter the beer better is the taste. The bitterness in beer terms mean better flavor which is produced by adding aroma hop flowers. According to CNBC news, the reason for rise in craft beer sales is its high IBU among the home brewing company that’s growing from garage to thriving commercial company. Our analysis shows that max IBU by states appears to vary between the state ranging from 138 to 0  with Oregon being the highest (138) and Arkansas the lowest (44.11).
